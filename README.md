# Python
Porfolio of Python Code

1. Guise-Text_Adventure_Game

        This is a text adventure game I made a part of my first journey into Python. It started as a class project but I wanted to make it have a more nostalgic 
        feel so I worked on it a little more. It may not be the longest text adventure game out there but it has most of my favorite internet meme personalities
        that it was worth the extra time.

2. Youtube Channel Scraper

        I wanted to be able to see how many videos a Youtube channel had and collate publicly available information about these videos so I can go back to them and
        enjoy them at a later date.

3. Appium & Android Studio Emulator - Snapchat Channel Scraper

        Snapchat has some of the coolest and funniest short-videos out there, making it an amazing source of leads for creators that my team could possibly work
        with. Since there really is no consolidated source of Snapchat creators out there, even through paid services, so why not just get all the channels on the
        discover feed and find a way to qualify these leads through other available means.

4. Secret Santa During Covid

        Christmas is a very fun time but given how 2020 has been going, it won't be as social as we all would have hoped. So I made a script to run a Secret Santa
        randomizer for my work family and I to still be able to celebrate the season of giving.
