PURPOSE:
    A python game made as a submission for the Data Science class.

INTRODUCTION:
    Guise is a choose your own adventure game designed to have the same feel 
    as a Dungeons and Dragons playthrough. The player has 3 characters to 
    choose from and the story is changed based on this and succeeding choices.
    The goal is to survive the trials through by making the correct choices.
    
EXTRA:
    Easter egg ending based on GMM's Nic Cage Flick or Deodorant Stick video.
        - type "TAKE" on the following items: (Not "PASS")
            1. Deodorant Stick
            2. Bee Hive
        - correctly answer questions:
            1. Flick
            2. Deo Stick
            3. Flick

BUGS:
    Format of text changes based on console used.
        - works best if played using Spyder's native console
        - issues with using standalone python and other consoles
        
POINTS OF IMPROVEMENT:
    Loops can be more elegant.
    IF statements can be simplified to avoid deep nesting.

 Long ago, a cult, known to control the world from the shadows, has built a

 fell as they pleased. Lies, deceit and treachery were the currencies they 
 dealt in.
 
 Millenia have passed and the cult has long been forgotten, but the world has
 already been changed.
